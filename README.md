# MSc Computer Science Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my BSc Computer Science Project. This project aim for the creation of a 2D Multiplayer Network Game while implementing simple Artificial Intelligence mechanisms. The aim of this project is to investigate how various AI implementations can increase the entertainment and interactions within games, and how network capabilities can be applied to allow users through a P2P (pear-to-pear) or through network connectivity to enjoy a seemless interaction.
